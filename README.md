#From Word Embeddings to Item Recommendation

This work combines ideas from  Word2Vec and recommendation systems:
- Uses non-textual features; the check-ins; for the embeddings
- Extracts user-user, user-item and item-item relations 
- Integrates the extracted relations with different recommendation paradigms
  - Recommendation based on K nearest items
  - Recommendation based on N neighbors
  - Recommendation based on both K nearest items and N neighbors
